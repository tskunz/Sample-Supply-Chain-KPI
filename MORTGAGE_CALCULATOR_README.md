    rate=0.0675,      # Your current interest rate (6.75% = 0.0675)
    balance=450000,   # Your outstanding mortgage balance  
    payment=3200,     # Your current monthly payment (P&I only)
    remaining_months=300  # Months remaining on current loan
)
```

### Step 2: Define Scenarios to Compare

Customize the refinance scenarios you want to evaluate:

```python
scenarios = [
    ("30yr @ 6.25%", RefinanceOptions(
        new_rate=0.0625,        # New interest rate
        new_term_months=360,    # New loan term (360 = 30 years)
        closing_costs=8000      # Total closing costs
    )),
    
    ("30yr @ 6.00% (1 Point)", RefinanceOptions(
        new_rate=0.0625,               # Base rate before buydown
        new_term_months=360,
        closing_costs=8000,
        buydown_points=1.0,            # Number of points to buy
        rate_reduction_per_point=0.0025 # Rate reduction per point (0.25%)
